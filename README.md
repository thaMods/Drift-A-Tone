# Welcome to the development page for Drift-A-Tone, a simple instrument capable of an ever evolving sound!

## Here are the basics (what you do)
Keys 1-4 control each one a circle  <br />
Key 5 does the Fourier sum of the currently active tones and memorizes the resulting tone, 
binding it to the rightmost active circle  <br />
The up/down arrow keys raise or lower the pitch for the currently active circles  <br />

## What the instrument does:
It generates a separate Lorentz attractor based on the pitch of each circle, 
 which then shapes the sound signal <br />
It computes an entropy based variation index, which makes the sound ever changing  <br />
When no key is pressed for more than a second, it generates a statistical distribution  <br />
 from the pattern you follow when playing the instrument, which in turn, has the 
 instrument adapt to your style.

Enjoy / remix / recycle!
